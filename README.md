# Aplple-Vision-pro-Re-mastered
This is a special clone of Apple Vision pro webpage in which I fixed many of their static animations and brought them to live. Also I improved the navigation bar of the webpage which looks more appealing than the original one.

I will add-on more pages and update it with time.

Only problem comes when apple inc. decides to unuse the already being used images of their web page and take down their links. This directly cuts-off the videos and images which I have put this in the Clone and blank appears instead. I try to fix it when I notice. Please kindly consider this problem while surfing.
